    <h1>Final Project: Gradient Domain Fusion</h1>
    <p>In this project, I implemented Gradient Domain Fusion or in other words, Poisson Blending.</p>

            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <p> This project boils down to setting up the least squares equation and throwing it into a solver to get the blended result.
                The source image is defined as the image whose content is applied to the target image.
                The objectives that need to be minimized are the x and y gradients of the blended image subtracted with their respective gradients in the source image.
